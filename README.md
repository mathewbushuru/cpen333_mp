This is the final project for our system software engineering course (CPEN 333) at UBC. For the first part of the project we implemented a variety of the snake game using Python. The second part involved building a client-server socket application.

For the snake game we used:
 - Python's `multithreading` module to implement multithreading in the application
 - Python's `Tkinter` module to create a GUI for the program
 - Python's `queue` module for safe multithreading

For part 2, we implement a UDP pinger (client and server) using Python's `socket` module. In addition the program calculated the round trip time (RTT) for each request. We also simulated the variability of normal-use RTT delay by having the server randomly wait for some time between 5 to 50 ms before responding back. We also simulated packet loss by making the server randomly ignore a message/request with a probability of 10%
